# Books CRUD API

This is a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of books. The books data is stored in a MongoDB database, and the API also supports search and sorting functionalities.



# Features

Create: Add new books to the collection.
Read: Retrieve a list of all books or details of a specific book.
Update: Modify details of an existing book.
Delete: Remove a book from the collection.
Search: Filter books by title or author.
Sorting: Sort the list of books by title, author, or published date.


# Technologies Used

Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB
Mongoose (MongoDB object modeling)
dotenv (for environment variable management)
nodemon



# Getting Started

    ##Prerequisites

    Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
    MongoDB installed or use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-based database.
    A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code).

    ## INSTALLATIONS
    
    1. Clone repository:
       git clone https://github.com/your-username/books-crud-api.git
    
    2. Install dependencies:
       npm install epxpress mongodb bodyparser nodemon nodejs

       npm install init -y
    
    3. Setup Environment variables:
